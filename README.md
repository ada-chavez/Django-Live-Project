# Django-Live-Project

## Introduction
For two weeks of my time at The Tech Academy, I participated with my peers in a team developing apps for an interactive website,The AppBuilder9000, for managing one's collections of things related to various hobbies, as well as API and Data Scraped content for those hobbies. Working in the Django Framework was a great learning experience for fixing bugs, cleaning up code, and adding requested features. I worked on several user stories (both back-end and front-end) that I am very proud of. Since much of the site had already been built, I had the opportunity to create my own app for the site based on the subject of Cocktails. Over this two week sprint I had the opportunity to work on my project management skills and team programming that I'm confident I will use again and again on future projects.

Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets and navigation links.

## Building a basic App in Django
For the first user story I created a new app for the AppBuilder9000 called the Cocktail App. I registered the app and developed a base and home template. I then added a function to views to render the home page. I then utilized bootstrap to add some styling to my navbar.
